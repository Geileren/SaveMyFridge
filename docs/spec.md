# MVP
-  Functionality for adding recipes based on ingredients
-  Timekeeping for grocery due dates
    - **Challenge**: figure out how long things last in fridge
-  Functionality of adding groceries 
    - Optional weight/amount + warning if missing
-  Functionality for removing used items
    - Based on recipes for ease of use ?
        - Pop-ups "do you still have x?"
-  Accessible on multiple devices - so external storage of data 
-  functionality for matching available ingredients with recipes and recommending best options
    - geil siger junction tables til lookup?

# Nice to have
- Scan receipt to add groceries 
    - Maybe connect with grocery/receipt apps
- Push notifications for stuff about to become bad
- (smart) Grocery list in app
    - Functionality for generating based on recipes
    - When done shopping automatically add groceries to active list
- Tagging recipes (e.g. big portion, vegetarian, vegan etc. for sorting/filtering)
- personal rating of recipes? (for use in recommendation ordering)


# Personas 

**Sofie**: gider ikke handle i dag

**Geil**: gider godt handle men mangler ting

**Susanne**: bruger kun app som recipe repository 

# Extra ideer
- Madplan ?
- external recipe API + scrubbing (to limit ingredient types)
